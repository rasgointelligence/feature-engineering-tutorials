# Tutorials: Feature Profiling in Python
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/rasgointelligence/feature-engineering-tutorials/main) [![Chat on Discourse](https://img.shields.io/discourse/status?server=https%3A%2F%2Fforum.rasgoml.com)](https://forum.rasgoml.com/) [![Chat on Slack](https://img.shields.io/badge/chat-on%20Slack-brightgreen.svg)](https://join.slack.com/t/rasgousergroup/shared_invite/zt-nytkq6np-ANEJvbUSbT2Gkvc8JICp3g)

At [Rasgo](https://www.rasgoml.com/), we are data scientists on the mission to enable the global data science community to generate valuable and trusted insights from data in under 5 minutes. As we have marched forward on this mission, we’ve grown incredibly frustrated in the lack of helpful content and python functions that target feature engineering. We wrestle with these problems everyday and we wanted to provide a repository of recipes that showcase how to use the best tools available in this space. Additionally, we’ve built our own SDK ([PyRasgo](https://github.com/rasgointelligence/pyrasgo/blob/main/tutorials/PyRasgo%20Tutorial.ipynb)) for feature engineering that enables users to automatically track, visualize, and evaluate their feature engineering experiments to make more accurate and explainable feature engineering decisions. 

In that vein, this directory contains tutorials on how to generate common test-train data splits for modeling in Python. We sincerely hope this is helpful and please leave comments with any questions on what we can do to improve!

Please join us on the 
* [Rasgo Forum](https://forum.rasgoml.com) for questions about these recipies and PyRasgo.
* [Rasgo User Group Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/rasgousergroup/shared_invite/zt-nytkq6np-ANEJvbUSbT2Gkvc8JICp3g) to join our community.
* Video Tutorials on YouTube _(Coming Soon)_
